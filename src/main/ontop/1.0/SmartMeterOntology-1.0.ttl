  dc:description """The SEAS Smart Meter ontology defines `seas:SmartMeter` as physical system (`seas:Sensor`) that are designed to Compute 
  Metering on different  amount of matter, such as Natural Gas, Water and Electricity. Smart Meters are connected systems 
  which are able to send metering evaluation to some managing systems. In the current version Smart meter are composed 
  (`seas:subsystemOf`) of a traditional meter and a connector module which is connected to the meter. 
  The two systems form the smartMeter.
  In this ontology you will find concepts about 
    - Meters (`seas:WaterMeter`, `seas:GasMeter`, `seas:ElectricityMeter`) and their metering mechanism (`seas:Pulse`, `seas:Optic`, `seas:Disc`..). 
    - Connectors module (we treat currently the case of Fludia connectors seas:FludiaConnectors), these connectors can communicate thanks to  a 
    - `seas:CommunicationProtocol` such as `seas:LoraProtocol` and `seas:SigFoxProtocol`. These protocols communicate through `seas:RadioWave` Technologies.

                                that are excited to vibrate at resonant frequency. Coriolis meters are used with liquids and gases. 
                                When the fluid within the displaced section is at rest, both the upstream and downstream portion of 
                                the displaced section will vibrate in phase with each other. The frequency of this vibration is 
                                determined by the overall density of the pipe (including its contents). This allows the meter to 
                                measure the flowing density of the gas in real time. Once the fluid begins to flow, however, the 
                                coriolis effect comes into play. This effect implies a relationship between the phase difference in
