  Metering on different  amount of matter, such as Natural Gas, Water and Electricity. Smart Meters are connected systems 
  which are able to send metering evaluation to some managing systems. In the current version Smart meter are composed 
  (`seas:subsystemOf`) of a traditional meter and a connector module which is connected to the meter. 
  The two systems form the smartMeter.
  In this ontology you will find concepts about 
    - Meters (`seas:WaterMeter`, `seas:GasMeter`, `seas:ElectricityMeter`) and their metering mechanism (`seas:Pulse`, `seas:Optic`, `seas:Disc`..). 
    - Connectors module, these connectors can communicate thanks to  a 
    - `seas:CommunicationProtocol` such as `seas:LoraProtocol` and `seas:SigFoxProtocol`. These protocols communicate through `seas:RadioWave` Technologies.
